PyLRP â€” A python implementation of the Lightweight Routing Protocol
===================================================================

## Python architecture

PyLRP is proposed as a package. You can install it by using the `setup.py` 
script.

The package can be directly called from command-line. Run
`python -m lrp --help` to get help on its usage. Provided command-line tools 
are:

* `sniff`: kind of tcpdump sniffer; however, it displays only LRP messages, 
correctly formatted.

* `daemon`: the LRP daemon itself. Currently, this command is mapped to 
`LinuxLrpProcess`, as it is the only concrete `LrpProcess` subclass we have.



## Supported plateforms

Currently, **only linux with netlink and netfilter installed is supported**. 
However, the core of the protocol is available through an independent python 
abstract class: `lrp.daemon.LrpProcess`. To make it compliant with another 
platform, one should subclass it, as `lrp.linux_wrapper.LinuxLrpProcess` do.



## Testing

There is currently no automated tests.


### Start LRP in a docker container


#### Build the image
It is possible to test the PyLRP implementation by using docker containers. 
A Dockerfile is provided in `docker_image`. Just build it:

    docker build -t "$IMAGE_NAME"


#### Run the container
To run LRP with its own network stack, I use this command:

    docker run --network "$NETWORK_NAME" \
               --volume "${PROJECT_ROOT}:/root/pylrp:ro" \
               --privileged \
               --name "CONTAINER_$NAME" --hostname "$CONTAINER_NAME" \
               --entrypoint '/root/pylrp/docker_image/init_lrp.sh' \
               --workdir /root/pylrp/src \
               --env LANG=fr_FR.UTF-8 \
               --interactive --tty \
               "$IMAGE_NAME" \
               python -m lrp -v daemon eth0

Optionally, for the sink, add `0 --sink` to the last line.

To have a bash prompt on top of this node, e.g. to be able to see the
routing table / to ping other machines, use:

    docker exec -it "$CONTAINER_NAME" /bin/bash


#### Setting the network topology
If you launch many containers (in the same network), you should be able to 
route packets from a container to another. However, it won't be a real 
multi-hop network, as all communications between containers are allowed.

To limit the connectivity between containers, use `ebtables`:

1. Redirect all simulation specific traffic to a special table:
   
       ebtables -N "$NETWORK_NAME"
       ebtables -A FORWARD -i veth<xxxx> -j "$NETWORK_NAME"
   
   (the second line is to be applied to each virtual-ethernet interface 
   linked to the docker containers).
   
2. Drop all traffic reaching this table:

       ebtables -P "$NETWORK_NAME" DROP

3. Allow traffic between some specific containers:

       ebtables -A "$NETWORK_NAME" -i veth<xxxx> -o veth<yyyy> -j ACCEPT
       ebtables -A "$NETWORK_NAME" -i veth<yyyy> -o veth<xxxx> -j ACCEPT

4. Optionally, allow the sink to communicate with the host:
   
       ebtables -A "$NETWORK_NAME" -i veth<sinkxx> -o br-<xxxx> -j ACCEPT
